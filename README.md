## Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post
In this project, I am writing a data science blog post on medium to describe the CRISP-DM Process. This article is trying to answer three main questions:
* What are the most popular Programming Language in 2022?
* What is the relation between having a certain language and Knowing other languages?
* What is the relation between working with a certain language and Salary?
The data used for generating these results can be found [Here](https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2022.zip)  and was not included here to save the space.
you can find this article on medium in the following link: [Programming Languages Insights](https://medium.com/@ahmhashesh/programming-languages-insights-95d57079511b).

Feel free to provide any feedback.
